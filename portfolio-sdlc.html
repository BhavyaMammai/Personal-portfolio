      <h1>SDLC PROJECT - <span>Documentation</span></h1>
      <p>
        The <strong>SIX Project</strong> was an initiative aimed at conceptualizing a revolutionary streaming device to enhance the TV-watching experience. This device, envisioned to be connected via HDMI and Wi-Fi, would allow users to stream content from popular platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime directly to traditional TVs. It would also enable users to manage their streaming accounts, control the device remotely, and access detailed content information through platforms such as IMDb.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the project was not fully developed, I was involved in creating the full <strong>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</strong> plan and various technical documentation as part of the pre-development process. The goal was to simulate the planning, design, and deployment phases that would be followed in a real-world product development cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        My primary contribution to the SIX project involved laying out a comprehensive <strong>SDLC strategy</strong>. This included defining the project requirements, creating design documents, and formulating detailed strategies for development, testing, and deployment. The approach was intended to showcase how an organization would approach the development of a product of this scale, from initial concept to launch.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Role in the SIX Project</h3>
      <p>
        Hereâ€™s an overview of the phases I worked on:
      </p>
      
      <h4>1. Requirements Gathering</h4>
      <p>
        In this phase, I collaborated with stakeholders and conceptualized the core features and functionalities of the SIX device. I focused on defining both <strong>functional</strong> and <strong>non-functional</strong> requirements to ensure the device would meet user needs and industry standards. This phase involved:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Defining core functionalities</strong> such as streaming content, account management, and remote control operation.</li>
        <li><strong>Identifying non-functional requirements</strong>, including performance, security, and scalability, to ensure the device would be reliable, secure, and able to handle large amounts of data and traffic.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>2. System Design</h4>
      <p>
        The next step was to create system design documents. This involved conceptualizing how the device would interact with users and other systems. Some of the key design documents I created include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>System Diagrams</strong>: I created several diagrams to model the flow and interactions of the system, such as:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context Diagram</strong>: To outline the system's scope and boundaries, illustrating how the SIX device interacts with external systems like streaming platforms, IMDb, and user devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)</strong>: To define the database structure, illustrating how user data, streaming subscriptions, and content metadata would be stored and managed.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Flow Diagram (DFD)</strong>: To show the movement of data between the SIX device, users, and external services.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>3. Development Planning</h4>
      <p>
        Although the actual development was not carried out, I developed a <strong>detailed development plan</strong> for the project. This phase focused on breaking down the core features of the device into smaller, manageable tasks. I:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Defined key features such as account registration, user subscription management, and seamless integration with streaming platforms.</li>
        <li>Identified potential technical challenges (e.g., Wi-Fi integration, content streaming, and API interactions with third-party platforms).</li>
        <li>Proposed tools, frameworks, and technologies that would be used in the actual development phase (e.g., cloud infrastructure for content management, REST APIs for communication, etc.).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>4. Testing Strategy</h4>
      <p>
        Creating a comprehensive <strong>test plan</strong> was crucial in ensuring the product would meet its quality standards. I outlined the testing strategy that would be used to validate the features and performance of the device. This strategy included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unit Testing</strong>: To test individual components of the system (e.g., account management, subscription handling).</li>
        <li><strong>Integration Testing</strong>: To test how different parts of the system (e.g., the device interface, APIs, and the remote control) would work together.</li>
        <li><strong>System Testing</strong>: To ensure the overall system would function as expected under various scenarios, such as high user traffic, poor network conditions, or errors in external APIs.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>5. Deployment Strategy</h4>
      <p>
        The final step of the planning phase involved outlining the deployment and rollout strategy. I developed a plan for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>System-level testing</strong> to ensure the platform could handle large-scale deployment and real-world usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment Phases</strong>: I suggested an initial launch phase in Japan, with a step-by-step rollout plan to test the device and its functionality in a localized market before expanding globally.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring and Updates</strong>: Post-launch monitoring strategies were also defined to track performance, user feedback, and potential bugs to ensure timely updates and fixes.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Key Contributions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SDLC Documentation</strong>: I produced detailed documentation covering each phase of the SDLC. This includes requirements, system design, testing strategies, and deployment plans. While no actual code was developed, the documentation is a full simulation of how the project would proceed if developed.</li>
        <li><strong>System Design & Architecture</strong>: I created several essential design documents such as context diagrams, entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), and data flow diagrams (DFDs). These diagrams provided a conceptual understanding of how the SIX device would interact with users and third-party services.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing Strategy</strong>: I defined a structured test plan that would be followed to ensure the device met the defined requirements. This included unit testing, integration testing, and system-level testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment Planning</strong>: I created a deployment strategy with phased implementation and post-launch support, ensuring that the system could be scaled globally after initial testing in Japan.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>SIX Project</strong> allowed me to demonstrate my ability to plan and structure a complex software development effort. While the project was never fully developed, the SDLC documents serve as a valuable example of how a real-world product development process might unfold. The planning and documentation process not only enhanced my skills in system design and project management but also deepened my understanding of how different SDLC phases interrelate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The work completed in this project reflects my ability to:
