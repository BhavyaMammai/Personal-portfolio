        This Spring Boot shopping application provides a seamless and
        user-friendly shopping experience with features like user
        authentication, product management, and personalized user profiles.
        Utilizing an mysql in-memory database, it ensures efficient data
        handling and fast access during development. The application allows
        users to create accounts, log in securely, and manage their profiles
        while browsing and purchasing. It also includes functionalities for
        adding new products and viewing product details for admins. The frontend
        is built using Thymeleaf, ensuring dynamic and responsive web pages that
        integrate smoothly with the backend. Users can also add to cart and make
        payments. Admins get the order and update the status of the order.

          <strong>Product Management:</strong> The application allows for the
          addition and listing of products and categories for admins. Users can

        <li>
          <strong>Personalized User Profiles:</strong> Users can create and
          manage their profiles, which are linked to their shopping activities.
          The profile includes basic user information and facilitates a

          <strong>Mysql Database Integration:</strong> The application uses the
          MySql in-memory database for storing user and product data. This
          ensures fast data access and easy management during development. All
          data entered through the UI is saved in the database, making it
          convenient to test and validate functionalities.
